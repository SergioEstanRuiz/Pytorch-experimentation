# Pytorch-experimentation
A series of Jupyter notebook explaining the basics of Pytorch, with some sporadic mathematical context. Right now we have, in this order:
1. *LinearRegression.ipynb* : introduction to PyTorch by building a simple polynomial regression for synthetic data. 
2. *MNISTclassifier.ipynb* : we construct a basic image classifier and introduce concepts like convolutional layers and cross-entropy loss.
3. *Time_Series_Introduction.ipynb* : we start looking at time series models. We construct a simple neural network and test it on synthetic data coming from a Gaussian process. We also provide a comparison with a classical AR(2) model.
