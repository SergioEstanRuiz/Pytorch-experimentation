    "- First we download the MNIST dataset, and convert the 28*28 images into Tensors. We separate into a training and testing set. \n",
    "- Then we use the `DataLoader`, which is a class which enables us to efficiently load and process the data into mini-batches for training and testing. Specifically, `train_loader` and `test_loader` are instances of the `DataLoader` class. What are these? They are objects over which we can iterate (see below during the training chunk of code) and at each iteration we get a batch of images and labels. That is, when we do `images, labels = next(iter(train_loader))` we get a tensor of size (batch_size, channels, height, width). In our case this is just (64,1,28,28) since the images are in a greyscale so there's only 1 channel, and the images are 28*28."
